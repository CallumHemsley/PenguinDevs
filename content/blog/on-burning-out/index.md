So i've been doing the [#100daysofcode](https://penguindevs.xyz/100-days-of-code/) challenge this last month since I got back from my vacation.

To recap, all that means is:

- Do 1 hour of coding per day.
- Share your progress everyday.

It sounds easy. And to begin with, it was easy. I was having fun learning React Native by building my first mobile application.

*"It's only an hour per day, how could I not do that"* - me.

Well, it turns out, it's actually quite challenging, depending on your circumstances.

After about a week of doing this challenge I started realising I was running out of time after work, to the point where I was decreasing my sleeping time by up to an hour.

So therefore I started tracking my time to see where I was losing it, and as it turned out: **I was doing too much**

### What my daily schedule looked like

- I leave for work around 7:15am and get back around 6:00pm.
- Once arriving back, I would usually face time my girlfriend or family for half an hour.
- From this point, there are usually 3 main things I would want to get done before going to sleep/relaxing.
  - Chinese practice/learning (flashcards/watching videos/learning new vocabulary) (1 hour *minimum*)
  - The #100daysofcode challenge (1 hour of coding *minimum*)
  - meditation/journal reflection

In total this would take 2 and half hours minimum. So in the ideal case, I would be done for the day by 9pm, and could have an hour to relax, before reading/going to bed around 10pm.

But life isn't that simple. Some days, I would be so tired from an intensive day at work that I would just daydream for half an hour, before getting anything done. Other days I would force myself to do the 1 hour minimum even if it wasn't productive at all, just to convince myself I was doing something.

At work, I think partly because I'm an intern, I don't have many meetings. This is a good thing because I'm not distracted often and I can learn and code for the majority of my day. However, as a result of this, mentally I'm exhausted after work. Forcing myself to do extra is just not productive.

So for the past week, due to trying to get myself to do to much, I think i've burnt out a little. You might call it fatigue rather than burnout. I felt like I had lost my motivation to create a mobile application, and all I have wanted to do this past week was relax after work.

This is also having a toll on my mental health as I'm giving myself a lot of pressure to improve and do more. I think this isn't the right approach, as I think i'll be more happier in the short and long term by **doing less but being more selective**.

Until recently, my wrist has been injured, so I haven't been able to go to the gym. However it's healed now, so I want to incorporate going to the gym 3 times a week into my life. Right now, there's just no way I can fit it in.

Therefore, my plan is to change how I'm doing #100daysofcode.

## The new plan

Coincidentally, I'm currently reading the 4 hour workweek. I can't comment much on it, as I've only just started. However, the book suggests focusing on 4 targets for a 6 month period. For me, those 4 targets in my current situation are:

- Healthy body (working out and eating well)
- Healthy mind (meditation everyday)
- Being fluent in Chinese
- Use technology to create something to help the environment

As you can see, since I'm already doing 4/5 hours of coding a day, 100daysofcode isn't really a priority for me for the remaining sixth months of my internship. Having said that, I still want to code outside of work, but I don't want to force myself to because of some challenge.

Therefore I'll be continuing working on my mobile application and sharing my progress, but **not every single day** if I feel too exhausted.

This has really taught me that balance is important, and it's also really important to constantly reflect and ask yourself why you are doing the things you are doing.

Today I wanna ask you guys, what do you think about this? Am I just making excuses? Or is this the smart move? Do you guys have similar experiences?
