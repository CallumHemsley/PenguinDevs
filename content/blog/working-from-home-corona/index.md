As a university student I have always fantasized about having the freedom to work from anywhere, would that be my home, a coffee shop or somewhere else entirely.

So when it was announced that my entire office would be working from home, I was really excited to finally trial that.

This post is about my initial experiences, compared to what I expected working from home would be like.

## Why work from home

Freedom is quite an important thing to me. I've always wanted to control the *what*, *where* and *when*.

However when you are just beginning your career, it's very challenging to be able to do that. I have roughly 2 hour commute per day (there and back).

That's an extra **10 hours per week.** That's a **lot of time**.

Not only that, but I either cycle or take the bus to work. If I take the bus to work, it costs 25 pounds a week. For an intern like myself, that's not exactly cheap.

So saving this money and time has allowed me to have more free time, which I have realised is incredibly important to me, as a result of taking this internship and losing the free time I had while at university.

## Has it affected my work?

Everything that I did in the office, I can do at home, almost as easily. For example my previous project was a react web development project, so as long as I am connected to the company VPN, I'm totally fine.

However, being an intern, I like to ask a lot of questions and sometimes need help from more experienced people within the team.

Initially, it felt harder to ask questions, as sometimes its quite hard or awkward to describe your problem/question using just text. Sometimes, it's easier if they just come over to your PC and can see exactly what you mean.

For the first few days, I didn't ask many questions, and tried my hardest to google etc more, even if it meant wasting more time. I think this was a good and a bad thing. I wasted more time, however I also **learnt more**.

However after a couple of days, if I was really stuck I started voice calls with mentors, and shared my screen. I can also give my mentors the controls of my PC in the case that I'm unclear about something. After starting to do this, there wasn't much difference between asking for help in person, and asking for help remotely.

Having said that, I can see why there are not many 'remote' internship opportunities. Perhaps if I was at the start of my internship right now I wouldn't have any idea what to do. Luckily I've been here for 6 months now and am able to work rather independently.

I'm currently working from my desk, within my bedroom. I think this isn't ideal, as my bedroom environment has always been a place of rest for me. I like the idea of having **separate zones** for *work* and *non-work* related things.

As a result, I've noticed that at non-work times I'll think about work more often, and at work times I'll be slightly less focused. I suppose since it's only been a week so far, I'll get more and more used to this.

I would say that I'm quite a focused and self-disciplined person overall, so my productivity at work hasn't taken a huge hit. Having said that, this pandemic situation has definitely taken a toll on my overall wellbeing, but I realise how lucky I am that I can even continue working now.

## How to stay focused

I like to use one of my study techniques, the [pomodoro method](https://francescocirillo.com/pages/pomodoro-technique) to stay focused. The basic premise is that you work for 25 minutes, then take a 'short break' of 5 minutes. You repeat this 4 times, then take a 'long break' of 20-30 minutes. 

This allows your brain to assimilate new information and get sufficient rest. I find that I can't efficiently sustain focus for any longer than 25 minutes. In these breaks I make sure to look away from any screens, and maybe go outside with a cup of tea for a couple of minutes if the weather is nice. [Here](https://tomato-timer.com/) is the online timer I use.

Another thing I do is remove **all** distractions from my desk, such as my phone and personal laptop. Although I'm self disciplined, it's easier to remove the temptation entirely just in case.

I'm lucky in that I have a decent desk in my room so I don't need to share a work space with others, but I still put on some noise cancelling headphones. That's not to say I'm always listening to music though, as I've found this leads to [audio fatigue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Listener_fatigue).

It's also easy to start work in pajamas, but I think this decreases my productivity, so I dress as I would if I were going into the office. This allows you to more easily get into the 'work' mindset you would be accustomed to.

## Getting lonely

Honestly, before actually doing remote work I couldn't think of many negatives.

One thing I noticed about 2 or 3 days into working from home was that it was lonely compared to being in the office. Even if I was in the office mostly focusing and not talking much, there were still times when I would go for a cup of tea and chat with people around the office. You start to notice you are missing those things after a while.

Since we are currently locked in fully, it's not like I can go work in a coffee shop or something like that, which I might prefer to do from time to time. 

## Conclusion

Today I wanna ask you guys, what do you think about this? Do you have any special tips for working from home?
