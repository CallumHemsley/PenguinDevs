So I've been a software intern for almost 4 months now at MediaTek, based in Cambridge, United Kingdom.

*disclaimer* : This post is purely based from **my** experiences, and could be totally different for others.

So what do I mean that the internship hasn't been as I expected?

Well, let's start by going back to just before I started the internship. 

As a result of recently finishing an exchange year abroad, I hadn't actually been to the MediaTek offices, as I had done all interviews, etc online. This added to my anxiety as I was going to an place that I had never actually been before. Stepping into the unknown if you will.

### Mistakes on your first day

If you ever have been, or are in fact, a prospective intern, you will agree that the lead up to the first day is very nerve-wracking.

However the simple truth is that your first day, even your first week, will not be very intensive.

Logically, why would it be? The company will not have many expectations of you, especially when starting.

We've all heard those horror stories from places like */r/cscareeradvice* where an intern deletes the entire production code or something ridiculous on their first day.

Here's the boring truth: In my first day I didn't even *look* at code, let alone write any.

Again, logically this makes sense. Most companies, especially if big, are going to have a **HUGE** codebase, it's almost impossible to start contributing from your first day.

My first day almost entirely consisted of meetings, the kind you would likely get at any desk job, such as health and safety procedures, IT procedures, etc. 

Afterwards, I set up my email system and then had a meeting with my line manager, where I was introduced to my mentor.

My mentor introduced me to a **small** portion of what the team had currently built (purely from a high level perspective), and explained the big picture via diagrams. 

I still felt clueless after this, but I had a basic grasp on what was happening. 

### Being introduced to the code

I was slowly introduced to code over the following week. I think a common way this is done is that the mentor will give you one or two small bugs to try and fix. Or even make you document some code. The clear advantage of this is that you get to trawl through the code yourself, which will you a better understanding of not only how to the code works, but coding conventions such as styling, tabs vs spaces etc.

That's why I was surprised that this wasn't the case for me.

Instead, I was immediately tasked with rebuilding a website, from the ground up, with performance the primary factor, as well as giving it a *'new design and feel'*.

Even more surprising, was the fact that I had **free reign over how to design/build this**. 

My mentor suggested that I research various framework/library options e.g React/Angular and then choose one, justifying to my mentor why I will use it.

I was also advised to create some small prototypes of the website in each library/framework before making an official choice.

Due to having some experience with React such as creating a dynamic blogging engine, as well as other technical reasons, I decided to go with React.

The fact that I even had the choice here was extremely surprising. My expectation was that I would be very limited in terms of choice since it would be expected that I don't have the experience to make such a decision.

This has meant that I've been extremely independent at work, since **no one** else knows React. Therefore my 'Googling' skills and understanding of documentation has improved dramatically. (Also a big thanks to open source maintainers who helped answer my questions.) 

However, unfortunately this also means that I've not been given much feedback on my coding. I also don't need to interact with my colleagues much as my project is quite isolated, I need only interact with my mentor, to confirm what APIs I need from the backend. This means that I haven't had many chances to go through other peoples code at work, trying to understand and perhaps 'steal' techniques that they use.

### Pressure at work

What I've come to realise, for interns specifically, is that there is almost **no** pressure.

As interns, we are there to learn as much as possible about what a real software developer position is actually like. (strikingly different to what is taught at university) There are other reasons, but that *should* be your primary reason.

However, from the companies perspective, this is a great way to essentially **train** a junior in their codebase. In some countries, another advantage for companies is that they will pay interns very little or nothing at all, compared to a freshly graduated junior, who would be paid properly.

### Flexibility

Something else that surprised me was the flexibility at work. I can essentially come in any time I want, take an hour lunch break at anytime I want, and then finish after around 8 and a half hours of work.

I remember I did some work experience at the company my uncle worked for, where the developers had to use a card and note down exactly when they came and left work. They had to have at least the minimum number of hours at work, to the minute.

Since that was my only experience, I assumed MediaTek would also be like that, but thankfully, it's very flexible. The premise is as long as you're getting work done, your time in the office won't be questioned, which makes total sense to me.
