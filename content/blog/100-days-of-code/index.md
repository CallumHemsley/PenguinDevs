![100 days of code](/top.jpg)

I've been a software intern for almost 6 months now at MediaTek, based in Cambridge, United Kingdom.

This past week I decided to take up the *#100daysofcode* challenge. I wanted to write a quick post explaining why I am doing this, and why you should too, no matter what stage you are in your career.

### What is *#100daysofcode*?

To summarise, #100daysofcode is a challenge with two main rules:

- Do a **minimum** of 1 hour of coding per day for 100 days straight.
- Tweet/Post about your progress **every single day**.

You can find out more [here.](https://www.100daysofcode.com/)

> Actually, I didn't realise I had to **tweet** my progress each day until this write up, but I have been posting my progress on instagram. [Check it out here.](https://www.instagram.com/penguindevs/)

### Why am I doing it?

I know that the majority of people doing this challenge are new to development, where as I'm already at an internship level. Personally, I think it doesn't matter what level you are at. The main objectives of the challenge are to build coding habits, as well as foster a positive community around learning to code.

Firstly, I realized that apart from maintaining this blog, I haven't been coding outside of work since I started the internship. Now I think that's totally okay, especially if you've got lots of other things to do, and don't feel like coding outside of work.

However for me, I've been wanting to start some kind of side-project outside of work for a while now, but hadn't committed to it.

By publicly participating in this challenge, I'm not only holding myself accountable publicly, but am also receiving support from others doing the same thing. There's a brilliant and positive community around #100daysofcode, so I feel like I'm not alone in doing this.

Furthermore, over my winter vacation, I had been reading [The Power Of Habit](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Power-Habit-Why-What-Change/dp/1847946240) (**highly recommend**), and therefore now have a better understanding of habits and how much impact they have on our lives. By doing 1 hour of coding a day (ideally around the same time of the day), programming will quickly become a habit, and therefore effortless.

I have always noticed that the toughest part of coding/doing a project is **starting**. But once you get going, it doesn't feel like such a pain anymore. 

As explained in [the war of art](https://www.amazon.co.uk/War-Art-Through-Creative-Battles/dp/1936891026) by Steven Pressfield, whenever you want to do something difficult or worthwhile, there is always this *resistance* feeling that tries to guide you away from doing what you wanted to do. By building this habit and forcing yourself to do just an hour each day, the resistance slowly fades away.

So far I'm only a week in, and on some days it's been really tough to find that 1 hour after work to code. But so far, I've managed to do it. It's also made me realise that although I may feel tired, I'm still capable of doing things after work.

Having said that, balance is of course extremely important, and that's why I ensure I leave an hour or more per day to unwind before sleeping.

### Why should you do it?

If you've had a side project in mind for a while, or have found a new framework/language that interests you, this is a great way to hold yourself accountable and **get you started**.

It's easier to get things done when you have support from others in a similar situation to you, and that's what I love about *#100daysofcode*.
